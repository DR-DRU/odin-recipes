        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 small zucchini, cut into french-fry shaped pieces</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 
                Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Season zucchini pieces with salt.</li>
            <li>Mix panko bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, 
                and Italian seasoning in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Dip zucchini pieces into the beaten eggs and 
                then press into bread crumbs to coat; 
                gently toss between your hands so any bread 
                crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. 
                Arrange breaded zucchini onto the prepared 
                baking sheet in a single layer.</li>
            <li>Bake zucchini in preheated oven until golden brown, 
                about 15 minutes.</li>           
        </ol>
